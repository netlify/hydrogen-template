# Hydrogen template: Skeleton

Hydrogen is Shopify's stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), Shopify's full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal setup** of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

### How do I configure my Hydrogen session / storefront client / customer account client / cart handler?

See `app/lib/context.ts` and the Hydrogen documentation.

### How do I configure a real Shopify store in local dev?

See `.env` and
[these Shopify instructions](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-storefront-api/getting-started).

### I get a 500 error on the `/accounts` pages. How do I configure real Shopify customer accounts in local dev?

See [these Shopify instructions](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen).

### `shopify hydrogen preview` fails with `Cannot find module '@shopify/mini-oxygen'`

The `shopify hydrogen preview` command previews your site in a local
simulation of the Oxygen hosting platform. It therefore isn't compatible with a site intended to be
deployed to Netlify.

Instead, use the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) (e.g. `netlify serve`).
